MOTIVI NAVIGATION DRAWER

When there is insufficient space to support tabs, side navigation is a good alternative. Side navigation can display many navigation targets at once. A drawer remains hidden until invoked by the user.

Apps with a single “home” should list the most frequently accessed destinations at the top of side navigation.

Side navigation may appear either with or without a navigation drawer.

Appropriate for these hierarchies:

Lateral navigation
Parents with siblings or peers
Recommended for:

Apps with many top-level views
Enabling quick navigation between unrelated views
Deep navigation structures
Reducing visibility of infrequent destinations


MOTIVI BUTTON

Bottom navigation bar

A bottom navigation bar allows users to quickly move between a small number of top-level views.

Appropriate for these hierarchies:

Parents with embedded child views
A group of parent views
Recommended for:

Frequent switching between views
Apps with few top-level views
Promoting awareness of alternate views
Mobile devices, as bottom navigation is located in a more ergonomic location











MOTIVI SEARCH

Expandable search

Use expandable search when search is not the primary focus of your app.

Behavior:

Display a magnifying glass icon in the toolbar instead of a search text box.

Touching the search icon causes the toolbar to transform, clearing other content and displaying a search text field. If voice search is supported, the microphone icon also appears.

The search text field automatically receives focus, and, if needed, the onscreen keyboard will appear. Historical search suggestions can be shown beneath the toolbar. Choosing any of the suggestions submits the query.

Touching the up arrow closes search and restores the original presentation of the toolbar.

PERCHE LA RICERCA è SI IMPORTANTE MA NON FONDAMENTALE, UNA PERSONA CERCA EVENTI IN BASE A LUOGO E DATA NON IN BASE AL NOME PRECISO
